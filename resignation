Resignation Letter
First of all, I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you. However, after serious consideration, 
I decided to end my work ahead of schedule. 
 
I need to tell you that I am seriously thinking about it during these days. 
Sorry to bring you the inconvenience.During nearly two mounth working in Citi, I have learned a lot from work and from you all. 
The reason that I choose to leave is that I want to return my hometown because my parent really need me,
so I’m sorry to say that I choose to leave.And I hope 02/12/2019 is my last day working here.
I would appreciate it if you would accept my resignation。
I would like to say thanks for giving me this chance, Thanks for your help, 
Thanks again for your kindly instruction and support during my work.
Thank you for all that you have done to me.

Best Regards!

Sincerely
